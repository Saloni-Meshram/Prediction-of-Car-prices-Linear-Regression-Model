# Prediction of Car prices-Multiple Linear Regression Model
In this Kaggle notebook, we embark on a journey to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on its various features. To achieve this, we follow a systematic approach that involves feature selection, data preprocessing, and model analysis.

# Feature Selection
Selecting the right features is crucial for building a predictive model that performs well. We begin by exploring the dataset and identifying the features that are likely to have the most significant impact on predicting car prices. Through careful analysis, we narrow down the feature set to those that exhibit strong correlations with the target variable â€“ the car price. This process ensures that we focus on the most relevant information while avoiding potential noise from irrelevant features.

# Model Analysis Using Statsmodels
For in-depth insights into the relationships between variables and the target variable, we turn to the Statsmodels library.Statsmodels offers detailed statistical summaries that provide information about the coefficients, p-values, and other statistical metrics associated with each feature. This helps us understand the strength and significance of each feature's impact on the car price. By examining these results, we gain valuable insights into which features have the most substantial influence and how they contribute to the final predictions.
